        <div class="cat"><img src="./cat.png" alt="cat">
            <p>A cat is a small, carnivorous mammal of the family Felidae, order Carnivora. It is the only
                domesticated species in the family Felidae, and was tamed in the Near East around 7500 BC. Cats
                have supple bodies, long tails, specialized teeth and claws, and finely molded heads. They are also
                called domestic cats or house cats when kept as indoor pets.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="deer"><img src="./deer.png" alt="deer">
            <p>Deer are a family of hoofed ruminants. They have two large and two small hooves on each foot and
                antlers in the males of most species and in the females of one species. Deer live mainly in forests
                but may be found in deserts, tundra, and swamps and on high mountainsides.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="elephant"><img src="./elephant.png" alt="elephant">
            <p>Elephants are the largest land mammals on earth. There are three different species of elephant: the
                African Savannah elephant, the African Forest elephant, and the Asian elephant. Elephants have
                distinctly massive bodies, large ears, and long trunks</p>
        </div>
        <div class="tiger"><img src="./tiger.png" alt="tiger">
            <p>The tiger (Panthera tigris) is the largest living cat species. It is most recognisable for its dark
                vertical stripes on orange fur with a white underside. The tiger is an apex predator that primarily
                preys on ungulates, such as deer and wild boar</p>
        </div>

        <div class="lion"><img src="./lion.png" alt="lion">
            <p>The lion is a large and powerful cat that lives in Africa and Asia. It is known as the king of the
                jungle because of its majestic mane, strong claws, and sharp teeth. Lions are predatory animals that
                hunt and eat hoofed animals like wildebeests, zebras, and antelopes. They have a long body, a big
                head, and a muscular tail that helps them balance when they run or hunt</p>
        </div>
        <div class="squirrel"><img src="./squirrel.png" alt="squirrel">
            <p>Squirrels are rodents with strong hind legs and bushy tails. They are found all over the world,
                except in Australia, where they were introduced by humans. They vary in size, colour, and form, and
                live in trees or on the ground. They are mostly active during the day or at dusk and dawn, but some
                are nocturnal</p>

        <div class="fox"><img src="./fox.png" alt="fox">
            <p>Fox, any of various members of the dog family (Canidae) resembling small to medium-sized bushy-tailed
                dogs with long fur, pointed ears, and a narrow snout.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="zebra"><img src="./zebra.png" alt="zebra">
            <p>Zebras are closely related to domestic horses. They are large single-hoofed ungulates built for speed and
                long-distance migrations. Zebras typically stand about 120-140 cm (47-55 inches) at the shoulder. Male
                Grevy's zebras are larger than females; in the plains zebra and the mountain zebra, the sexes are nearly
                the same size.</p>
